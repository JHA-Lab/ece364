# ECE 364: Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics

Welcome to ECE 364! In this course we present basic concepts in machine learning for predictive data analytics:
* **Information-based learning:** decision trees; Shannon’s entropy model; information gain; ID3 algorithm; feature selection; predicting continuous targets; tree pruning; model ensembles: boosting, bagging.
* **Similarity-based learning:** feature spac, distance metrics, nearest neighbor algorithm, noisy data, predicting continuous targets, various measures of similarity, feature selection.
* **Probability-based learning:** Bayes' theorem; Bayesian prediction; curse of dimensionality; conditional independence and factorization; Naive Bayes model; smoothing; continuous features: probability density functions, binning; Bayesian networks. 
* **Error-based learning:**  simple linear regression; error surface; multivariate linear regression; gradient descent; learning rate; handling categorical features; modeling nonlinear relationships; multinomial logistic regression; support vector machines.
* **Deep learning:** artificial neural networks; activation functions; backpropagation and gradient descent; vanishing gradients; weight initialization; categorical target features: softmax layer and cross-entropy loss; dropout.
* **Evaluation:** misclassification rate; confusion matrix: precision, recall, F1 measure, profit/loss; prediction scores: receiver operating characteristic curve, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, gain/lift; measures of error; evaluating models after deployment.
* **The _art_ of machine learning:** perspectives on prediction models: parametric vs. nonparametric, generative vs. discriminative; choosing a machine learning approach: no free lunch theorem, project requirements, data considerations.
